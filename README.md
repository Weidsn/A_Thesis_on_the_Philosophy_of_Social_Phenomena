## A Thesis in the Social Sciences and Humanities

In my thesis, *An Individualist Account of the Social World*, I introduce a comprehensive English-language framework that aims to describe our social world (and the myriad of social intereactions therein) in a precise and unambiguous way.

### Chapter 2

### Chapter 3 - 5
The MR-N framework is presented in detail. 

### Chapter 6 - 9
Contain a series of applications for the MR-N framework and a series of arguments for singularism against collectivism.
