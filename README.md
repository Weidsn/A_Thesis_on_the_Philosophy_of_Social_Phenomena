In my thesis, [*An Individualist Account of the Social World*](https://github.com/Weidsn/An-Individualist-Account-of-the-Social-World/blob/main/An%20Individualist%20Account%20of%20the%20Social%20World.pdf), I introduce a comprehensive linguistic framework for describing the entirety our social world (and the myriad of social concepts) in a precise and unambiguous fashion. This thesis is approximately 100 pages long. 

## Introduction

A precise and unambiguous linguistic framework is crucial for the development and progress of pure mathematics. Such a useful tool, however, is largely unavailable to philosophers and social scientists. The precision and clarity of the language of mathematics—the language of proofs—have significantly reduced the likelihood of misunderstandings and, therefore, the cost of communication among mathematicians. In contrast, philosophers have devised numerous isolated, domain-specific frameworks with limited scopes of application, understood only by small groups. We typically call them "philosophical jargon." 

In this thesis, I aim to present a novel and comprehensive linguistic framework that does NOT make any unnecessary social or cultural assumptions, allowing people (or even machines) from all backgrounds to adopt it for their own purposes, much like the framework of mathematics. With such a framework, philosophical discussions can proceed without first having to embark on a tedious sub-project of concept disambiguation, saving time and energy for the main topics. 

This is where the MR-N framework comes in. Here, ```MR``` stands for ```Motivating Reasons``` and ```N``` stands for ```Norms```.

## Chapter 1
For the purpose of satisfying thesis requirements, I take a stance on a philosophical debate between collectivism and singularism. The framework I present is singularist under this distinction. Chapter 1 can be skipped if you are not interested in this philosophical debate. 

## Chapter 2
I summarize and rephrase the key challenges that the MR-N framework is designed to overcome. This summary will help readers to understand the rationale behind my structuring the framework as it is.

## Chapter 3 - 5
The MR-N framework is presented.

## Chapter 6 - 9
I apply the MR-N framework to a number of social scenarios. Next, I present my arguments in favour of singularism over collectivism through a discussion of the popular collective concept of "joint commitment."
